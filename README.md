# Parallelization-Strategies
## Parallelization Strategies for String Search and Image Processing

This repository contains a report detailing the implementation and performance analysis of parallel algorithms for two distinct problems: string searching using recursion and divide-and-conquer, and image processing (grayscale conversion). The report explores the application of different parallel programming paradigms, including OpenMP, MPI, and OneAPI, to these problems with the source code for the paralell algorithms included as well.

**Key aspects covered:**

* **Recursive String Search:** A recursive approach to count word occurrences in a sentence, along with parallelization strategies using divide-and-conquer.
* **Image Processing (Grayscale Conversion):** Implementation of a grayscale conversion algorithm for PNG images and its parallelization.
* **Parallelization Strategies:** Detailed explanations of the parallelization techniques employed for both problems using OpenMP (shared-memory parallelism), MPI (distributed-memory parallelism), and OneAPI (heterogeneous parallelism).
* **Performance Analysis:** Includes timing graphs and reflections on the effectiveness and limitations of the specific parallelization strategies used for each approach and parallel programming framework.
* **Research References:** Citations to relevant academic work that informed the development and analysis of the algorithms.
* **Limitations:** Discussion of the challenges and limitations encountered with each parallelization approach.
